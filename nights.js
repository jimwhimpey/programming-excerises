/* 
	Interview Questions
	Provide a set of positive integers (an array of integers). Each integer represent number of 
	nights user has requested at a hotel. If you are a host, you need to design and implement 
	an algorithm to find out the maximum number a nights you can accommodate. The constrain 
	is that you have to reserve at least one day between each request.

	Example:
	1) Input: [1, 2, 3] ===> output: 4, because you will pick 1 and 3
	2) input: [5, 1, 2, 6] ===> output: 11, because you will pick 5 and 6
	3) input: [5, 1, 2, 6, 20, 2] ===> output: 27, because you will pick 5, 2, 20
